# Sonos App Bug Tracker (Unofficial)
The new Sonos apps, v80, are in a bit of a state. Here is an attempt to track the main problems, so we can see how things are progressing. (There's no code in here).

Check the _Issues_ tab for everything we know about.

# Opening Issues
First, see if there's already one that covers it. If it is, great, add a comment if you can provide more information. (No +1s please).

If there isn't an existing item, create one, start by clicking on the _Issues_ tab. Mark it as a _Bug_ or a _Deleted Feature_. Ideally include whether it is on iOS, Android, or the web app.

# No Ranting
Please, no ranting here. Save that for:
