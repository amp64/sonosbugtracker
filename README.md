# Sonos Bug Tracker
The new Sonos apps, v80, are a problem. Here is an attempt to track the main problems, so we can see how things are progressing. There's no code in here.

Check the Issues tab for everything we know about.

# Opening Issues
First, see if there's already one that covers it. If it is, great, add a comment if you can provide more information. (No +1s please).
If there isn't an existing item, create one, start by clicking on the _Issues_ tab. Mark it as a Bug or a Deleted Feature. Ideally include whether it is on iOS, Android, or the web app.

# No Ranting
Please, no ranting here. Save that for:
